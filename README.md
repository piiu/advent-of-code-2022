## My entry for the fabulous [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) 

### Requirements: 
- PHP 8.1
- Composer

### Installation 
1. `composer install`
2. Add a [WolframAlpha AppID](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/) to `config/app.ini` 

WolframAlpha is only necessary for day 21 part 2. If no AppID is configured, the result will be an equation that can be solved by hand.

### Run 
`composer day [number]`

### Issues
- Day 12 part 2 is not automated and needs human interaction
- Day 16 part 2 runs forever
- Day 19 is missing due to trauma from day 16
- Day 22 part 2 is missing (WIP)
- Day 24 is missing (WIP)
