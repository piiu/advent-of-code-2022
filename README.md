## My entry for the fabulous [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) 

### Requirements: 
- PHP 8.1
- Composer

#### Installation 
`composer install`

#### Run 
`composer day [number]`

### Issues
- Day 12 could use some heavy optimisation and an automated solution for part 2
- Day 15 part 2 is slow
- Day 16 is missing (for now!)
- Day 17 part 2 takes forever
